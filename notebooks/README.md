# Example Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the usage of the Deep SVDD implementation for remote sensing image retrieval.

## Example Notebook

The `example.ipynb` notebook demonstrates:

1. Loading and preprocessing remote sensing images
2. Initializing and training the Deep SVDD model
3. Performing image retrieval
4. Evaluating retrieval results

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required packages from `requirements.txt`

### Running the Notebook

1. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Start Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

3. Navigate to the `notebooks` directory and open `example.ipynb`

### Dataset

The example notebook uses sample images from the `datasets/sample` directory. You can replace these with your own remote sensing images.

## Note

Make sure to replace the sample image paths in the notebook with your own image paths when running the example.
